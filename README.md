Module 21

Overview of the analysis: The purpose of this analysis is to train a modelt to predict if a donor's money will be used successfully based off of several factors.

# Data Preprocessing

* First I dropped the EIN and Name columns as they weren't relevant.  Then I determined the count of each application and determined to use the 'Is_Succesful' column for the model.
* What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model? 
* What variable(s) are the features for your model?
* What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?


## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
